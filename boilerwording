I have learned how the suite of AWS IT cloud computing services can be used separately or in combination to address common problems in computing and how to develop robust, flexible, and cost-effective cloud solutions.
Apply best practices for creating an AWS-based cloud solution, Leverage AWS computing services to provision virtual machines, Implement highly durable and reliable storage systems , Transparently handle spikes in demand with elastic load balancing and auto scaling
My Certifications are my way of demonstrating my skills and establishing my credibility.
Achieving credentials should allow me to get heavily involved in AWS-related projects, or present myself as a credible subject-matter expert.
Having AWS-certified employees helps to identify skilled team members and reduce the risks when implementing projects on AWS.
Having AWS-certified employees can also help you to build your business, as it is one of the criteria for the higher tiers of membership in AWS Partner Network (APN).
Being a member of the APN gives access to a wide variety of benefits, including training subsidies, AWS usage credits, marketing, support and much more.
